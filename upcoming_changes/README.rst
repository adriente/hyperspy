This directory contains "newsfragments" which are short files that contain a small **ReST**-formatted
text that will be added to the next ``CHANGELOG``.

The ``CHANGELOG`` will be read by **users**, so this description should be aimed to hyperspy users
instead of describing internal changes which are only relevant to the developers.

Each file should be named like ``<ISSUE>.<TYPE>.rst``, where
``<ISSUE>`` is an issue number, and ``<TYPE>`` is one of:

* ``new``: new user facing features, like new command-line options and new behavior.
* ``bugfix``: fixes a bug.
* ``doc``: documentation improvement, like rewording an entire session or adding missing docs.
* ``deprecation``: feature deprecation.
* ``enhancements``: improvement of existing functionality, usually without requiring user intervention.
* ``api``: a change which may break existing script, such as feature removal or behavior change.

So for example: ``123.new.rst``, ``456.bugfix.rst``.

If your PR fixes an issue, use that number here. If there is no issue,
then after you submit the PR and get the PR number you can add a
changelog using that instead.

If you are not sure what issue type to use, don't hesitate to ask in your PR.

``towncrier`` preserves multiple paragraphs and formatting (code blocks, lists, and so on), but for entries
other than ``new`` it is usually better to stick to a single paragraph to keep it concise. For ``new``,
it is recommended to add hyperlink to the user guide.


To previous a draft of the changelog, run from the command line:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ towncrier build --draft
